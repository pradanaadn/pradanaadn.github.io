In this post, we will be creating a chatbot for Bank Assurance Product using Gemini. This project will help user to access information about the Bank Product more easly.

In the first step, we will prepare the development environment, I use [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), an extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust.

```bash 

uv init

```
it will create a file `pyproject.toml` and some other file. Then we will install the dependency:
```bash
uv add -r requirements.txt

```
You can access the `requirements.txt` file in this link.
